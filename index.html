        <p>Alternative source of energy</p>
            <img src="img/alternative-energy-sources.jpg" alt="picture wind turbines solar panels family look in the future">
            <p class="text-content"> Alternative energy encompasses all those things that do not consume fossil fuel. 
            They are widely available and environment friendly. They cause little or almost no pollution. 
            There have been several alternative energy projects running in various countries to reduce our dependence on traditional fossil fuels. 
            There are many impressive options that you can take into consideration such as solar tankless water heater reviews. 
            Here in you will learn more about alternative energy sources that you can take into consideration.

          <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
            <p class="text-content"> Solar is the first energy source in the world. It was in use much earlier before humans even learn how to light a fire.
               Many living things are dependent on solar energy from plants, aquatic life and the animals. 
               The solar is mostly used in generating light and heat. 
               The solar energy coming down to the planet is affected by the orbital path of the sun and its variations within the galaxy. 
               In addition, it is affected by activity taking place in space and on the sun. 
               It was this energy that is believed to have been responsible for the breaking of iceduring the ice age, which creates the separation of lands and sea.

      <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
      <img src="img/green-field-wind-turbines.jpg" alt="green field wind turbines">
          <p class="text-content">This is one of the energy sources that have been in use for a very long time and for centuries. 
          It was used in powering sailing ships, which made it possible for explorers to sail around their trade routes in distant lands. 
          A single windmill can power the crop irrigation, and the family energy needs, water pumping and electric lights. 
          However, in the present time there are several windmills that are used to generate required energy mostly for industrial uses. 
          Many of the wind turbines can capture much power all at once before feeding it to the power grid. 
          This is commonly know as wind farms and has been in use for many years all round the world. 
          It is only the United States that is going slow in terms of accepting this alternative energy source.
